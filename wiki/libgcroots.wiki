== About ==

SigScheme uses and bundles a garbage collector supporting library separated from [http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Hans_Boehm/gc/ Boehm GC], named libgcroots. This library abstracts architecture-dependent part of garbage collector roots acquisition such as register windows of SPARC and register stack backing store of IA-64.

If you are a software packager or developer interesting in GC implementations, separated package of the library is also available for you.

See [http://uim.googlecode.com/svn/libgcroots-trunk/README README] for further information.
